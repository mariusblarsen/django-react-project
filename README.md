# Just a simple Django and React project
A little project for learning purposes and fun, to get deeper knowledge of React and other tools along the way. Resulting in a foundation for future projects.

## Setup
Add a Django secret key to `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` by replacing `django_secret_key_here`.

### With docker-compose
Navigate to folder *django_react_project* and run `docker-compose up`.
The React app is now available at port 3001, with api and django-admin page at port 8000
